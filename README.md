# A serial bootloader

Currently it just works for dsPIC33FJ128GP802 pic chip.

A bootloader allows reprogramming of a microcontroller without the need for special hardware. This one I wrote from scratch. dsPICaBootable is the PC application while dspicboot is the program that live on the microcontroller.

## dsPICaBootable

Cross platform PC/Mac/Linux application written in C++ Qt.

## dspicboot

Program that lives on the microcontroller. Written in PCWHD C.
